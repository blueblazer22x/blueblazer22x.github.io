# CCCS Drama Recordings

UPDATE: As of August 13, 2025 these links are no longer active. If you'd like a copy of the shows please provide Mrs. Cunningham with a flash drive. Thank you. 


This site contains links to download video files of our recent CCCS Drama recordings. After clicking the link of the show you'd like to download, you will be redirected to an Amazon Photos page like the one in the example below. Click on the 3-dot menu in the upper right part of that page, then click "Download to device". (NOTE: Due to their large size, these files will not play in your web browser, they must be downloaded as seen below)

These files are large and may take awhile to download depending on your internet speed. Once downloaded, the video files can be played on a Windows PC using the Media Player app, or you can use most other media players on your phone or computer regardless of operating system.

We will leave these links up for a few months to give everyone a chance to download the shows.  Alternatively, you may provide Mrs. Cunningham with an empty USB flash drive at least 64GB or larger and we can copy the files to your drive.
